# 🐍 Python Automation: Social Engineering Script

## Project Overview
As an aspiring Red Teamer, I am learning Python to automate tasks. 
This project is a **Phishing Template Generator**. It automates the creation of pretexting emails, allowing a user to input variables (Name, Company, Link) and output a formatted attack vector.

## Skills Learned
- **Input/Output:** Handling user data dynamically.
- **Variables:** Storing payload information.
- **Automation:** Reducing the time required to craft social engineering drafts.

## The Code
The script uses the `time` library to simulate processing delays and f-strings for template formatting.

## Proof of Concept
Below is the script running in the terminal:
