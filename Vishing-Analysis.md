# 🛡️ Security Advisory: Understanding Vishing (Voice Phishing)

## Executive Summary
Vishing (Voice Phishing) is a social engineering technique where attackers use telephony to induce individuals into revealing personal or financial information. Unlike standard phishing (email), vishing leverages **urgency** and **human psychology** to bypass critical thinking.

## 1. The Attack Vector: "The Tech Support Hoax"
A common entry point for vishing is a **Browser Locker** or malicious pop-up.
*   **The Trigger:** The victim visits a compromised website. Their screen appears to "freeze" or displays a fake virus warning.
*   **The Lure:** A phone number appears on the screen, claiming to be "Microsoft Support" or "Apple Care," instructing the user to call immediately to fix the issue.

## 2. The Script: Anatomy of the Call
Drawing from analysis of real-world scams, attackers often follow a structured script designed to build authority and panic.

### Phase 1: The Introduction (Building Trust)
> **Attacker:** "Hi, this is Alex from IT Support. We detected unusual activity on your network. We are updating the servers and I see your account is desynced. Can you read me the error code on your screen?"

### Phase 2: The Escalation (Creating Fear)
If the victim hesitates, the attacker shifts to "Authority Mode."
> **Attacker:** "Ma'am, I need you to listen. This IP address is linked to illegal activity. We have a report generated here for the FBI/CBI. If we don't fix this now, your device will be permanently blocked."

*Analysis:* This utilizes the **Authority Principle**. By mentioning government bodies (CBI/FBI/IRS), the attacker puts the victim in a defensive state, making them compliant.

## 3. The Impact
Despite appearing obvious to technical professionals, these attacks are highly effective against the general public.

*   **Victim Volume:** Approximately **8% of Americans** (nearly 21 million citizens) fall victim to phone scams annually.
*   **Daily Frequency:** Averages over **57,000 successful scams per day**.

## 4. Mitigation Strategies
*   **Never trust Caller ID:** Numbers can be easily spoofed using VoIP software.
*   **The "Hang Up & Call Back" Rule:** If you receive a call from a bank or tech support, hang up. Find the official number on the back of your card or the official website, and call them back.
*   **MFA Awareness:** Never share a One-Time Password (OTP) or 2FA code over the phone. Support agents will never ask for this.
